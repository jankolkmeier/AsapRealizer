# AsapRealizer 
## A BML Realizer for incremental, fluent, multimodal interaction with a virtual human or robot
----

AsapRealizer is a novel realizer, jointly developed by the Social Cognitive Systems group in Bielefeld and the Human Media Interaction group in Twente. It is a fusion of our state of the art behavior realizers ACE and Elckerlyc.

AsapRealizer is a  BML 1.0 compliant behavior realizer for generating multimodal verbal and nonverbal behavior for virtual humans and robots. It is designed specifically to allow very fluent interaction between the virtual human and its human interaction partner. To this end, AsapRealizer provides behavior generation elements that support incremental behavior construction (including emergent gesture co-articulation) and interactional coordination (e.g. behavior synchrony, fluent turn taking, active listening, attentive speaking). Animation in AsapRealizer is generated using a mix between the precise temporal and spatial control offered by procedural motion and the naturalness of physical simulation.
